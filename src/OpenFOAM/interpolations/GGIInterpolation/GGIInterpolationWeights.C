// Rescaling the weighting factors so they will sum up to 1.0 This is
// necessary for the slave weighting factors because intersection with
// master neighbours are usually computed from different projection
// plane, so the weighting factor don't quite sum up to 1.0 For the
// slave weighting factors, we are usually talking of delta of the
// order of 10e-6 here.
//
// For the master weighting factor, this is another story. We truly
// expect that the master weighting factors will exactly sum up to 1.0
// if all the neighbours are properly identified.
//
// However, for concentric circular geometry, if the circumferantial
// resolution is too coarse, we will end up with some part of the face
// surface that are not taken into account because they do not
// physically overlap any neighbours.  For example, think of 2
// concentric circular patches, slightly rotated one relatively to the
// other.  A good case: the ercoftac conical diffuser, Case0...  GGI
// located right between the cylindrical and conical parts, rotate the
// cylindrical by 15 degrees.  For this case, we will need to devise a
// decent strategy in order to intelligently take care of these
// "missing weights"
//
// The purpose of the ::rescaleWeightingFactors() method is mainly for
// this.
