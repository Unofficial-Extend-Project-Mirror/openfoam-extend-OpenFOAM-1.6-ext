  terms of the GNU General Public License as published by the Free Software
  Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or (at your option) any later
  version.  See the file COPYING in this directory, for a description of
  the GNU General Public License terms under which you can copy the files.

* System requirements
  OpenFOAM is developed and tested on Linux and Mac OS X.
  Experimental Microsoft Windows port is currently not released - please follow
  the user forum and annoucements

  * Linux
  To check your system setup, execute the foamSystemCheck script
  in the bin/ directory of the OpenFOAM installation. If no problems are
  reported, proceed to "3. Installation"; otherwise contact your system
  administrator.

  If the user wishes to run OpenFOAM in 32/64-bit mode they should consult the
  section "Running OpenFOAM in 32-bit mode".

  * Apple Mac OS X
  The recommended way of running OpenFOAM on the Mac is to download sparse disk
  images, mount them on your system and link them into

  ~/OpenFOAM/OpenFOAM-<VERSION>
  ~/OpenFOAM/ThirdParty-<VERSION>

  Both disk images support case-sensitive file names.  If you wish to compile
  OpenFOAM and Third Party packs from scratch, please create a case-sensitive
  disk image using the Disk Utility, mount them as above and unpack the sources
  at appropriate places.  The remainder of build instructions is identical
  to Linux.

* Installation
  Download and unpack the files in the $HOME/OpenFOAM directory as described in:
  http://www.extend-project.de/

  The environment variable settings are contained in files in an etc/ directory
  in the OpenFOAM release. e.g. in

  + $HOME/OpenFOAM/OpenFOAM-<VERSION>/etc/
  + where <VERSION> corresponds to the version 1.6-ext etc

  1) EITHER, if running bash or ksh (if in doubt type 'echo $SHELL'), source the
    etc/bashrc file by adding the following line to the end of your
    $HOME/.bashrc file:

    + . $HOME/OpenFOAM/OpenFOAM-<VERSION>/etc/bashrc

    Then update the environment variables by sourcing the $HOME/.bashrc file by
    typing in the terminal:

	+ . $HOME/.bashrc

  2) OR, if running tcsh or csh, source the etc/cshrc file by adding the
    following line to the end of your $HOME/.cshrc file:

    + source $HOME/OpenFOAM/OpenFOAM-<VERSION>/etc/cshrc

    Then update the environment variables by sourcing the $HOME/.cshrc file by
    typing in the terminal:

	+ source $HOME/.cshrc

*** Installation in alternative locations
    OpenFOAM may also be installed in alternative locations. However, the
    installation directory should be network available (e.g., NFS) if parallel
    calculations are planned.

    The environment variable 'FOAM_INST_DIR' can be used to find and source the
    appropriate resource file. Here is a bash/ksh/sh example:

	+ export FOAM_INST_DIR=/data/app/OpenFOAM
        + foamDotFile=$FOAM_INST_DIR/OpenFOAM-<VERSION>/etc/bashrc
        + [ -f $foamDotFile ] && . $foamDotFile

    and a csh/tcsh example:

	+ setenv FOAM_INST_DIR /data/app/OpenFOAM
        + set foamDotFile=$FOAM_INST_DIR/OpenFOAM-<VERSION>/etc/cshrc
        + if ( -f $foamDotFile ) source $foamDotFile

    The value set in '$FOAM_INST_DIR' will be used to locate the remaining parts
    of the OpenFOAM installation.

* Building the ThirdParty packages from Sources
   A new way of compiling and installing the ThirdParty suite of packages is proposed with OpenFOAM-1.6-ext. 
   Please consult the file ThirdParty/README.ThirdParty a for more information.

* Building from Sources (Optional)
  If you cannot find an appropriate binary pack for your platform, you can
   build the complete OpenFOAM from the source-pack.  You will first need to
   compile or obtain a recent version of gcc (we recomend native gcc,
   coming with your operating system) for your platform,
  which may be obtained from http://gcc.gnu.org/.

  Install the compiler in
  $WM_PROJECT_INST_DIR/ThirdParty/gcc-<GCC_VERSION>/platforms/$WM_ARCH$WM_COMPILER_ARCH/
  and change the gcc version number in $WM_PROJECT_DIR/etc/settings.sh and
  $WM_PROJECT_DIR/etc/settings.csh appropriately and finally update the
  environment variables as in section 3.

  Now go to the top-level source directory $WM_PROJECT_DIR and execute the
  top-level build script './Allwmake'.  In principle this will build everything,
  but if problems occur with the build order it may be necessary to update the
  environment variables and re-execute 'Allwmake'. If you experience
  difficulties with building the source-pack, or your platform is not currently
  supported, please contact <enquiries@wikki.co.uk> to negotiate a support
  contract and we will do the port and maintain it for future releases.

* Testing the installation
  To check your installation setup, execute the 'foamInstallationTest' script
  (in the bin/ directory of the OpenFOAM installation). If no problems are
  reported, proceed to getting started with OpenFOAM; otherwise, go back and
  check you have installed the software correctly and/or contact your system
  administrator.

* Getting Started
  Create a project directory within the $HOME/OpenFOAM directory named
  <USER>-<VERSION> (e.g. 'jasak-1.6-ext' for user jasak and OpenFOAM
  version 1.6-ext)
  and create a directory named 'run' within it, e.g. by typing:

  + mkdir -p $HOME/OpenFOAM/${USER}-${WM_PROJECT_VERSION}/run

  Copy the 'tutorial' examples directory in the OpenFOAM distribution to the
  'run' directory.  If the OpenFOAM environment variables are set correctly,
  then the following command will be correct:

  + cp -r $WM_PROJECT_DIR/tutorials
    $HOME/OpenFOAM/${USER}-${WM_PROJECT_VERSION}/run

  Run the first example case of incompressible laminar flow in a cavity:

  + cd $HOME/OpenFOAM/${USER}-${WM_PROJECT_VERSION}/run/tutorials/incompressible/icoFoam/cavity
  + blockMesh
  + icoFoam
  + paraFoam

* Reporting Bugs in OpenFOAM
  Please report all bugs and feature requests using our bug tracking system:
  http://sourceforge.net/apps/mantisbt/openfoam-extend/main_page.php or 
  http://www.extend-project.de/project-final/openfoam-extend-bug-tracker
  Please also report bugs at the CFD-Online User Forum.

* Running OpenFOAM in 32-bit mode on 64-bit machines
  Linux users with a 64-bit machine may install either the OpenFOAM 32-bit
  version (linux) or the OpenFOAM 64-bit version (linux64), or both.  The 64-bit
  is the default mode on a 64-bit machine.  To use an installed 32-bit version,
  the user must set the environment variable $WM_32 (to anything, e.g. "on")
  before sourcing the etc/bashrc (or etc/cshrc) file.
